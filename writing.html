    <h3>The Flower of Fargo’s Diner</h3>
    <p>---November---</p>
    <p>The sun came up, pouring its sweet, golden beams into Vanessa Fargo’s room. It was a Sunday. The day of rest. But Vanessa’s eyes shot open as soon as her alarm sounded, her face settling into the paranoid and restless expression that was becoming her signature. It had been a week since her sister had gone missing, and Vanessa’s day of rest would not come for a long
time.</p>
    <p>---June---</p>
    <p>Veronica’s summer had started out like any other- sleeping until the afternoon, playing video games and reading for hours, and listening her friends complain about the summer homework she had already finished. But this summer was turning out to be different. This year, her parents had decided that she was old enough to work at the family restaurant with her older sister, Vanessa.</p>
    <p>Despite only being two years younger, Veronica was noticeably less mature than Vanessa. While her older sister spent almost an hour getting ready in the morning and used up most of her paycheck on clothes, Veronica seemed to just throw on whatever was clean. While her older sister had a mysterious social life, which involved coming and going at random hours, keeping up at least 20 Snapchat streaks, and suspiciously turning off her GPS whenever she was supposed to be sleeping over at a friend’s house, Veronica’s idea of a party was watching Mean Girls with two people at most.</p>
    <p>But while the average observer would assume there was some kind of resentment in their relationship, they were as close as two people so different could be. That was why Veronica was so excited to wait tables with her- she would be able to hang out with her sister without the chance that she’d go off to do whatever it was that required her to keep her location a secret.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>“I haven’t seen you up this early since Christmas.”</p>
    <p>Vanessa’s dad was already sitting at the counter when she came downstairs. She should have appreciated his attempt to crack a joke, but it only filled her with more disgust. Why even put up this semblance of being normal when your daughter is missing? Why eat or sleep or watch TV or do anything else when you could be doing something, anything to bring her back? But instead of telling him this, Vanessa decided it was too early to get into a fight and responded with a halfhearted laugh.</p>
    <p>“We’re talking to the police again today.”</p>
    <p>“Hm.”</p>
    <p>“They’re trying to trace her phone, but they haven’t had much luck.”</p>
    <p>“Look, honey, they’re doing the best they can. Missing persons cases can be difficult to even start, especially when there were no noticeable signs that the person would run away.”</p>
    <p>Vanessa stared at her father, unable to respond. What could she say without being accused of making up stories? How could she tell them what she saw without claiming that magic was real?</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>It turns out that Veronica wasn’t the only new addition to the restaurant’s staff that summer. When she walked into the training session, she had expected to see her sister and a few other local high school kids. But standing at the edge of a rectangular table was a man she had never seen before, in the restaurant or in town.</p>
    <p>The man was tall and gaunt, and appeared to be in his late twenties. His dirty-blond hair was haphazardly pulled back with a rubber band, and he wore a basic and somewhat dingy-looking black t-shirt. He looked like either a broke college student or a seedy attendee of the music festivals Vanessa went to a couple times per summer. But what struck Veronica the most about him was his face. There were two long, jagged scars running vertically from his forehead, through his eyebrows, then down his cheeks all the way to his jaw. Following the path they traced led Veronica’s gaze to his eyes, which almost shocked her more than the twin scars. The right one was pristine and blue, but the left was a light, almost white, gray. While Veronica was taking in all of the man’s oddities, he slowly turned and looked at her. When they locked eyes, his face immediately morphed into an expression of shock. His pupils dilated, and his mouth began to tremble, as if he was suppressing a laugh. Veronica suddenly had a strong urge to run back to her room and cover herself with blankets. But before she could act on this, her sister and father cheerfully strode into the room, signaling the beginning of another summer at Fargo’s Diner.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>Vanessa hadn’t paid any mind to her new coworker, Don- he was strange-looking, sure, but he wasn’t any more intimidating than her friends. What she found odd, however, was the interest he took in her sister. Not just because she was young, but because, well, Vanessa was just more attractive. If this guy was going to be a creep, she thought, why go to jail over a girl who dressed like the nerd character from a 90s teen movie? She was disgusted at the fact that she could think these awful things about her sister, but there was no denying the fact that Veronica was basically a social reject-- always the last one picked in gym, always working on group projects alone. Still, Vanessa began taking notice of each time he spoke to her, and how much time they spent alone. It was probably nothing, she assured herself, but she should just make sure, for her sister’s sake, that Don’s intentions were good.</p>
    <p>Vanessa’s gut feeling turned out to be right. He was a predator, but not in any way she could have ever imagined.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>Veronica couldn’t believe how wrong she had been to be afraid of Don. The creepy guy from training soon became the nice cashier at the diner, until finally she felt comfortable calling him a trusted friend. He laughed at her jokes, understood her obscure anime references, and didn’t seem to mind the fact that she looked like a pre-schooler’s face painting endeavor whenever she attempted to put on makeup. He just seemed so worldly and experienced. He would always give her hints about the way the world worked, and always tried to convince her of her own inner worth. One day, he made her a strange, yet intriguing, offer.</p>
    <p>It was closing time at the diner. A lazy Sunday in July. The town Veronica and her parents lived in was small and old-fashioned, so not many people were out and about on a Sunday night. As it happened, she and Don had been assigned to work the closing shift.</p>
    <p>“Seen the new Avengers movie yet?” Don asked with an amicable smile, starting up what was bound to be another one of their delightfully nerdy, hours-long conversations.</p>
    <p>“Not yet. Probably next weekend. You?” Veronica replied.</p>
    <p>“Yeah. It really gets into their origin stories. Like how they discovered their powers and decided whether to use them for good or evil.”</p>
    <p>Veronica nodded, eager to hear his thoughts on the matter.</p>
    <p>“But what was really interesting to me was the thought that any one of us could have some insane ability and not even know it. Like, you could have telekinesis or something and you’d never even get to use it. Good or evil, you’d never even know.”</p>
    <p>He got up from the table he was working on, seeming lost in thought for a moment. But then his face split into his characteristic grin, and he turned to face Veronica.</p>
    <p>“I want you to try something,” Don said, more gravely than the conversation required.</p>
    <p>“See that lamp over there?” He pointed to an old moth-eaten lamp on the other side of the restaurant.</p>
    <p>“I want you to try to move it with your mind.”</p>
    <p>Veronica laughed, trying to hide how off-put she was by his tone. Hadn’t they just been talking about superhero movies? Why was he being so serious? Still, she thought his point was interesting. On the off chance she did have magic powers, she could probably use them to become more popular at school.</p>
    <p>She turned to face the lamp and closed her eyes. She wasn’t sure what she was supposed to be thinking about, but she concentrated on moving it. After a few minutes she was about to give up and laugh the whole thing off, but then she felt something. A surge of energy collected itself at the front of her face. She felt a great hotness behind her eyes, like she was about to cry. She opened her eyes, unnerved.</p>
    <p>Veronica gasped and nearly fell onto the tile floor. Every piece of movable furniture in the room was floating just beneath the ceiling, enveloped in a bright green glow. Suddenly, she heard a sound unlike anything she had ever heard. It was like a cross between a crow’s call and a sob. Startled, she wildly looked around as the furniture dropped to the floor. It was then that she found the source of the sound: Don was doubled over with laughter on the floor.</p>
    <p>“I’ve found you!” He gasped, nearly crying.</p>
    <p>“As soon as I saw you I knew it was you. The runes were right- I found the first part of the prophecy in this sleepy little town, wasting her summer away in this decaying relic of a restaurant.”</p>
    <p>Veronica slowly backed away, her mouth agape.</p>
    <p>“No, no, please don’t be scared! Look, I can explain later, but right now all you need to know is that you can save the world. Haven’t you ever felt like you don’t belong? That this world is unfair to people like you?”</p>
    <p>Hesitantly, Veronica nodded. He was beginning to make sense.</p>
    <p>“You’re part of something so much bigger than this place. With your abilities, you could have whatever you wanted.” His pupils were enormous, almost obscuring his damaged left eye.</p>
    <p>“If you come with me, I can help you use this amazing gift you have. You’re the chosen one. You could be like a superhero.” He sounded insane, but there was a core of truth to what he was saying. How many times had Veronica wished she could just be normal- like what everyone else liked, be able to make friends as easily as everyone else could, and have wild stories to tell like everyone else did. Like her sister did.</p>
    <p>“Where do you want me to go?”</p>
    <p>And so Veronica and Don spent the rest of the night planning her escape from the town that she had no use for. By morning, she would be gone. Gone! Her adrenaline kept her awake and alert while they prepared for the long journey ahead of them.</p>
    <p>But not alert enough to notice that Vanessa had been watching them from the kitchen. She couldn’t hear them, and she had been so shaken at Veronica’s display that she quickly left the scene to go to some random person’s party, eager to dismiss the whole thing as a trick of the light. But she had seen them. And dismissing the scene, Vanessa would find, would be a move that she would sorely regret.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>“What do you mean the police couldn’t find anything else?”</p>
    <p>Vanessa was seething with rage, her teeth bared almost animalistically. Her father looked broken and soulless, and his daughter’s anger seemed to add even more weight on his shoulders.</p>
    <p>“Her phone was found broken in the kitchen. And Don is nowhere to be found. But we can’t give up hope. At least we have a suspect. They’ll keep looking, and we can hire a private-”</p>
    <p>“No. They won’t do anything. They can’t.”</p>
    <p>“Vanessa, please, you can’t just dismiss them like this. They’ve been trained for cases like this. What makes you think they’re so incompetent?”</p>
    <p>A hurricane seemed to burst forth from Vanessa’s mouth.</p>
    <p>“Just about everybody is! None of us noticed what was going on in front of us even when it was hitting us in the face!”</p>
    <p>Vanessa stormed out of the room, taking no notice to her father’s perplexed look. Fine, she thought, let him realize now that he hired his daughter’s kidnapper. Brought her into his home.</p>
    <p>The moonlight turned Vanessa’s room a cold and menacing blue. She stood in the middle of her carpet with the lights off, thinking. The police would never believe her if she told the truth. There was only one thing she could do. The next day she would be gone as well, leaving her parents childless until she could bring her sister back for good.</p>

    <h3>Maybe We're Both The Devil</h3>
    <pre>he hurts to look at.

his awful, unbroken beauty wallows nervous excitement in my belly.

he is the fear i carried, personified,

the fear i carried of people like him,

the memories of sweet, nauseating, rushing, falling, fruitful, horrified, sick, palpitating, burning, rough, smooth, breaking, evil October and November,

the caring Satan to my disillusioned Eve,

the naive snake not knowing the fruit he offers me

is anything more than an apple.

is he afraid that i am using him as a crutch, or am i thinking too highly of his ability to distrust?

does he know how terrible i am, that i think of him only as a mechanism, a reason to avoid getting better on my own?

it’s strange. the juice of this apple is

so bitter.

it’s not as sweet as everyone said it would be. maybe i should leave before i</pre>

    <h3>Ithaca</h3>
<pre>Five years since I last drove down that dirt road
	Yet the hills have not forgotten me.
Wild red raspberries behind my grandparents’ ramshackle house
	Have forgiven me for abstaining from their tartness.

Stretches of cornfield dotted with
	Uninhabited trailers and silent silos taught me
Not to fear the disappearance of
	Jobs in the fabricated metal industry
Or summer
Or people, and to just stand with the dry yellow grass
	Under my feet.

Painted-lady houses on Aurora Street
	The used record and book shop on the commons
The best bagel place in the world and Cornell’s stoic brick library
	Will one day be gone
And no one will remember
	Ithaca

When glaciers slice through Buttermilk Falls again
	When earthquakes crack the pavement of Old Stone Quarry Road
When wildfires ravage the playhouse with heart-shaped windows built just for me
As if it never existed at all
I will not weep
	Because what matters is
It once was
	Ithaca.</pre>

    <h3>November Has Come</h3>
    <p>It was the end of October, and Tonni was running out of options.</p>
    <p>Too old for foster care, she had been bouncing around from couch to couch at different friends’ houses for the past three months-- and more recently, even acquaintances’ houses were on the table. After packing her things and quietly slipping out of coworker number seven’s apartment, Tonni planted herself on a park bench and scrolled through her phone’s contact list. Each name had one of two icons next to it-- a green check mark if she hadn’t crashed with them, and a red “x” if she had. She tried not to think about the dread that ballooned inside her as she realized her phone was looking overwhelmingly red.</p>
    <p>Tonni’s family had always been poor, but she didn’t really mind. Her mother always found ways to make things like holidays and birthdays fun without money. She would make clothes and stuffed toys for Tonni and her brothers out of leftover fabric from the craft shop she worked at. She would cover the walls of every cheap apartment they moved into with stickers from the convenience store bargain bin.</p>
    <p>They were never really poor, Tonni insisted, as long as they had a place to live. At a young age, Tonni had promised herself that she would never, ever-- under any circumstances --become homeless. Ever.</p>
    <p>Then the craft store closed down. Tonni remembered telling her mother not to worry, that she could stay with friends until she found a new job and could support three mouths again. It would only be a couple of weeks at most.</p>
    <p>That was three months ago.</p>
    <p>And now here she was, standing in front of a row of sleeping bags in a sporting goods store. She glanced at the price tags. The cheapest one was 55 dollars. She had 12.</p>
    <p>Tonni felt her phone buzz. It was a friend from middle school responding to her text asking if she could stay over, just for the night. She didn’t expect to get a response, seeing that she hadn’t seen this person in years. But sometimes people pleasantly surprised her.</p>
    <p>“Sure, as long as you’re okay with dogs. I have two.”</p>
    <p>She breathed a sigh of relief. She was allergic to dogs, but that didn’t matter.</p>
    <p>“One day at a time,” she muttered to herself. “Just a little while longer.”</p>

    <h3>The Flower of Myrtle Street</h3>
    <p>Vanessa Fargo sat still with her hands on her lap, looking out the window of the train. The car was crowded, and Vanessa had the entire seat to herself, but the piercing glares she directed at anyone who even looked like they intended to sit next to her sent the message that she clearly wanted to be alone.</p>
    <p>She clutched her backpack to her chest. It was 6 o’clock in the morning, and the early November sun cast a pink blush over the deserted night sky where it peeked above the horizon. Vanessa figured that her father would be up for his morning run by now. She gave her parents another hour before they realized she wasn’t in her bed, and another hour after that before they realized that she wasn’t on a morning walk either.</p>
    <p>She of course felt guilty for making her parents go through the unimaginable horror of a missing child for the second time that month. But she knew they wouldn’t understand in a million years why she needed to go to the city, and why she needed to stay there until her sister was with her again. Talking to the police was out of the question, too-- at best, they would think she was just grieving, and at worst, they would think she was crazy.</p>
    <p>To be frank, Vanessa wasn’t entirely sure that she didn’t think that about herself.</p>
    <p><em>A psychic message from your missing sister?</em> Something incredulous within her asked. <em>You know that’s impossible. Go back to your parents and stop being selfish</em>.</p>
    <p>No, Vanessa had to go to the city. And she could not come back until Veronica was with her.</p>
    <p>The squeal of the train pulling into the station dissipated her thoughts for the moment. She flipped her backpack around, tightening the straps and making sure all the pockets were zippered shut. Then, she pulled her rolling suitcase down from the overhead shelf. Finally, she pulled the hood of her gray sweatshirt snugly over her dark green Afro-- an unnatural hair color would be the first thing people noticed about her, and at the moment, she did not want to be seen.</p>
    <p>After gathering her things and exiting the train, Vanessa silenced her phone. She knew her parents would bombard her with calls after they realized she was missing, and she did not want any distractions-- especially those intended to change her mind and pull her back home. She had decided the night before that she would send them a short text explaining everything when she had reached her destination. Right now, however, her focus was on getting there as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>Vanessa’s destination was the hair salon owned by her aunt Cheryl, her mother’s sister. Cheryl was the “cool aunt” to Vanessa and Veronica growing up, taking them to PG-13 movies, making rainbow pancakes with food dye and a little bit of magic, and telling them stories about the various eccentric people whose hair she had styled.</p>
    <p>Vanessa didn’t know exactly how Cheryl would react to seeing her niece appear at her doorstep without warning and without the permission of her parents. Maybe she would send her home immediately. Maybe she would let her stay the night, but have her parents waiting for her at the kitchen table the next day. Maybe Cheryl’s loyalty to her sister would outweigh Vanessa’s loyalty to her own.</p>
    <p>Honestly, it didn’t matter what Cheryl did. Whether she welcomed her with open arms, no questions asked, or assumed the role of a responsible adult that she was so reluctant to accept, the fact of the matter was that Cheryl was just plan A. It would be nice not having to pay rent while she looked for her sister, but Vanessa had almost enough money for a few months’ rent in a cheap apartment-- well, a <em>really</em> cheap one. Even a hotel room would work. She had been saving up for a car since her freshman year of high school, and could probably afford a used one with the few thousand dollars in her checking account, but such luxury couldn’t be further from her mind right now.</p>
    <p>Singularly focused as she was, Vanessa couldn’t help but stare up at the captivating mural that adorned the ceiling of Chester Station. The station’s terminal was a gargantuan dome, and on its yawning ceiling was painted a variety of Greek and Roman myths. Between the figures of gods and monsters, twinkling lights were scattered to resemble the stars and constellations in the sky.</p>
    <p>Vanessa looked up at the mural and felt strangely comforted by its existence. Her eyes lingered on a depiction of Orpheus leading Eurydice out of the underworld, agony twisting his face as he prayed to the Gods that she truly was alive behind him. In the distance, Hades’ three-headed guard dog crouched menacingly. Vanessa knew how the story ended, but she still found herself hoping that this Orpheus would have the willpower not to turn around.</p>
    <p>Aunt Cheryl lived in a small but inviting apartment above the Beautiful Blades Hair Salon on North Myrtle Street. When Vanessa was small and Veronica even smaller, their parents would sometimes take them into the city for a weekend of fun with their aunt. For two and a half days, the girls would be allowed to stay up past their bedtime, eat sugary cereal for breakfast, and play in the park all they wanted. There was just one rule: Never set foot outside the iron fences guarding the far side of the park, where North Myrtle became South. Their mother and aunt would tell them stories about growing up in the city during the 70s, when kids walking home from school would get mugged or worse, and the only thing that separated their apartment from the most dangerous street in the city was the park’s lush emerald lawns and whimsical topiaries.</p>
    <p>Her mother’s warnings sat uncomfortably in Vanessa’s mind as she trudged through the city’s grid of criss-crossing streets. She attempted to quiet her thoughts by remembering what she had learned in her advanced American history class: that Chester was influenced by a variety of intersecting socio-economic factors during the 1970s, and that improvements in housing and infrastructure had greatly improved the city’s quality of life-- even for the boogeymen that the adults described as “bad” neighborhoods. She also knew that in the event of a robbery, she was statistically less likely to be harmed if she immediately gave the criminal the contents of her bags-- she had learned that in her criminology class.</p>
    <p>Logically, Vanessa knew that she was safe. Despite this, she was unable to rid herself of a lingering chill.</p>
    <p>What she had learned in class was also no help to her when she realized she had no idea where she was.</p>
    <p>Trying not to panic, she opened up the GPS app on her phone. If she was supposed to travel north by following the numbered streets for ten blocks, then take the E subway for three stops, then head East away from the fashion district, then… Wait, did she put the right address in?</p>
    <p>Disoriented and lost in thought, Vanessa wandered up and down the maze-like streets for what felt like hours. Although she had promised herself she would at least wait until she was falling asleep in either her aunt’s apartment or a sketchy hotel room that night to dwell on second thoughts, doubt crept into her mind like a rolling fog.</p>
    <p><em>Why couldn’t you have chosen to process this like a normal person?</em> She chided herself. <em>You think you’re so level-headed and rational, but here you are, running away to a city you don’t know without telling anyone and getting hopelessly lost. In this neighborhood, no less! And for what? Some dream? Come on.</em></p>
    <p>That was it. The dream that she knew was not a dream.</p>
    <p>Vanessa was not a superstitious person. She prided herself on her ability to make decisions based on facts, research, and observations. As such, she was not the type to change her mind easily. She had had her future all planned out: Finish high school at the top of her class, attend college at a large West Coast school famous for their criminal justice program, use her dual enrollment credits to graduate early, and become a federal judge before the age of 30. Until Veronica’s disappearance, there was nothing in the world that could have stopped her, especially anything having to do with psychic signals or telepathy.</p>
    <p>Two days after her sister was last seen, with the police scrambling for clues to her whereabouts and coming up with dead ends, Vanessa had returned home from a search party. She had thought she would never sleep again, but soon slipped into the dead sleep that only people with missing family knew.</p>
    <p>In the flat field of Vanessa’s psyche, Veronica’s clear voice rang out.</p>
    <p>“--Chester,” said the voice. Vanessa could only make out half of what it was saying. It sounded broken and fuzzy, as if it were being transmitted through an old radio.</p>
    <p>Vanessa assumed she was dreaming. She had a feeling that all her dreams would be about her sister for a very long time.</p>
    <p>The voice spoke again, much clearer this time.</p>
    <p>“I miss you.”</p>
    <p>This time, Vanessa felt a very real chill down her spine. Her sister was there. She knew Veronica was there; not visible or tangible, but there. It was as if she had never left.</p>
    <p>Vanessa became aware of an image in her mind’s eye. It flickered in and out of sight like a staticy TV picture, but she could see it. Her sister stood in front of her, wearing a black dress with a white Peter Pan collar that Vanessa had never seen before. Her relaxed, dark umber-colored hair had been cut into a bob. She appeared to be standing in someone’s kitchen-- she was standing in front of an oven from which a warm glow emitted. Well-worn cooking equipment was organized on the counter behind her, and Vanessa could see that farther away, an assortment of potted plants grew on the sill of a small window.</p>
    <p>Her sister looked safe. She was smiling.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the image became as clear as if Vanessa was standing in that kitchen herself. Veronica turned to her, still smiling.</p>
    <p>“I just went to Chester for a bit,” she said. “Don’t worry about m--”</p>
    <p>Vanessa jerked awake, trembling. She was more afraid than she had ever been in her life. But, conversely, she was also more sure of one thing than she had ever been, more than her career aspirations or college plans: She had to go to Chester. Somehow, her sister was there. She knew she was in that kitchen, wearing that dress she didn’t own and that haircut she didn’t have.</p>
    <p>Finally, Vanessa turned the corner onto South Myrtle Street. The neighborhood wasn’t a demilitarized war zone, but it certainly wasn’t a playground either. Street signs were covered in graffiti and peeled-off stickers. Termite-ridden furniture moldered on the curb. When she bought a bag of Doritos at an overstuffed corner store, the cashier shakily handed back her change from inside a metal cage. She guessed the store had been robbed one too many times.</p>
    <p>“I guess the old guys who wrote the textbooks never went to the places they were writing about,” She thought to herself. “So much for economic reform.”</p>
    <p>She plodded past a graying, seemingly abandoned red brick apartment building. Suddenly, a clamor of voices pierced the air from above. A fraction of a second later, three men who looked to be in their early twenties burst out of the apartment’s door and tore down South Myrtle. Another beat of a rabbit’s heart, and out bolted a short, svelte girl wearing all-black clothing and sporting hair dyed the most vibrant blue color visible to the human eye.</p>
    <p>“Give me my stuff back! I’ll break your kneecaps, I swear to god!” The girl raged after them.</p>
    <p>Vanessa’s heart sank. She really didn’t want to get involved, but the girl looked vulnerable and the men looked dangerous. She was obviously no match for them. Plus, the girl’s neon hair and unconventional word choice was enough to pique Vanessa’s interest. She sighed and ran after them.</p>
    <p>The men weaved through the crowds with ease, with the blue-haired girl shortly behind them, and Vanessa behind them even further. Despite the weight of her backpack and suitcase, and her less-than-perfect sense of direction, she was fast enough to keep them in view. After all, she was her high school track team’s star long-distance runner.</p>
    <p><em>Well</em>, she thought cynically, <em>I guess not anymore.</em></p>
    <p>The girl had almost caught up with the men when they came upon a crowded intersection. The light was green, and cars were zipping up and down the street like a bulging river after a storm. The men were able to weave in between the cars and slip into the crowd on the other side of the street, but the girl barreled into the road and was honked at angrily by drivers that seemingly had no intention of slowing down for her. She slumped down and sat on the curb with her head in her hands, her whole body crumpling with defeat.</p>
    <p>Gingerly, Vanessa approached the girl.</p>
    <p>“Um, hi?”</p>
    <p>The girl turned around and looked at her with what can only be described as pure, unadulterated contempt. In fact, if Vanessa didn’t know better, she could have sworn she had felt a burning sensation where the girl’s piercing glare met her eyes.</p>
    <p>She supposed this reaction was warranted. The girl had, of course, just lost something valuable. Vanessa didn’t take offense.</p>
    <p>“I’m Vanessa,” she tried again. “I saw you running after those guys back there. Do you need help with anything?”</p>
    <p>Warily, the girl stood up.</p>
    <p>“I’m Tonni. And I don’t need any help. Thanks.” She spit out her words as if they held a bitter taste.</p>
    <p>Now that she was standing right in front of her, Vanessa could see clearly what the girl-- Tonni, she said her name was? --looked like. She was wearing a black hoodie with a red skull-and-crossbones pattern. The sleeves had holes cut out where her thumbs poked through, like fingerless gloves. She was wearing what looked like a black petticoat, and under that, faded blue jeans with holes ripped out of the knees. Her eyes were haphazardly smeared with black makeup.</p>
    <p><em>Ohhh. You’re, like, one of those Hot Topic people</em>, Vanessa almost said. Not that there was anything wrong with that. The emos and goths were always nice to her at school. She didn’t understand why her friends made fun of them.</p>
    <p>“Who were those guys?”</p>
    <p>“Some idiots from my old school. I made the mistake of sleeping in the abandoned apartment complex they always hang out in. It’s no big deal, they just got my sleeping bag and like ten dollars.” Tonni looked down dejectedly, indicating that it was, in fact, a big deal.</p>
    <p>Vanessa was suddenly acutely aware of how lucky she was. It made her cheeks burn as she remembered how afraid she was of even setting foot on South Myrtle, while here this girl was, sleeping in one of its abandoned buildings.</p>
    <p>“Do you want to borrow my sleeping bag? I’m going to my aunt’s house and I’m probably not going to use it,” Vanessa chose her language carefully so as not to offend the girl. Making her feel like a charity case was a surefire way to send her running.</p>
    <p>Tonni looked at the ground, deliberating. She seemed to swallow whatever defensiveness she had held earlier quite quickly given the urgency of her situation, because she looked up and nodded.</p>
    <p>“I’ll give it back to you soon,” she tried to reassure Vanessa, although she knew she would probably never see it again.</p>
    <p>Luckily, Tonni knew the city well enough to guide Vanessa to Cheryl’s salon. Vanessa had protested, saying she had a GPS and didn’t want to trouble her, but Tonni had insisted on it as payback for the sleeping bag.</p>
    <p>“Besides,” she said playfully, “I’m much faster than your dumb phone.”</p>
    <p>Arriving at the salon, the girls exchanged numbers and shook hands. Tonni ran back off towards the park with a wave.</p>
    <p><em>See?</em> Vanessa told the voice of self-doubt that had been surprisingly quiet since Tonni and the men burst out of the abandoned building. <em>I’m supposed to be in this city</em>.</p>
    <p><em>I’ve made a friend already.</em></p>
    <p>She took a deep breath, and rang the doorbell.</p>
